Contribute to graphite
======================

Frustrated by poor, digital publication standards in academia and beyond, the co-authors of *graphite* set out to create a tool for nerds and tech newbies alike, which allows users to create well-layouted and responsive online publications without the backing of a publishing house or extensive webdevelopment knowledge.

The resulting framework *graphite* exists of the open-source python package graphite-paper and a bunch of starter packs.
If you would like to contribute to the exisiting framework or help develop the idea to something even greater, don't hesitate and contact the authors.

Add themes
----------

A repository for existing themes is in the pipeline. If you developed a beautiful theme, consider sharing the stylesheet or even the full starter.


Implement new plugins and components
------------------------------------

Components have been added on the go whenever the need for them came up. But there is still a universe of possiblities. You're welcome to fork the package repository, implement a plugin and create a pull request.

Improve architecture
